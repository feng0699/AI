# AI-Assisted Programming Project

Welcome to the repository for my project based on the **AI-Assisted Programming** course! This project is part of my learning journey in exploring AI's practical applications in IT-related work. I am the builder of this project and am actively learning as I progress. This repository reflects my work and understanding gained throughout the course.

## About the Course

**AI** has become a dominant topic in today's world, but many still don't fully grasp its practical applications. The course aims to bridge the gap between AI's perceived importance and its actual benefits, especially in IT roles. It focuses on two main aspects: the mindset and the expertise required to effectively use AI in real-world scenarios.

In this module, we delve into **AI-Assisted Programming**, leveraging the power of **GenAI**. Programming, traditionally seen as a developerâ€™s domain, can be beneficial for anyone looking to automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows. Through this course, I've learned how AI can help automate various tasks, such as:
- Collecting data from **Tableau**.
- Performing filters and data manipulations.
- Updating **JIRA** tickets.

These practical skills enable a more efficient and automated approach to problem-solving, enhancing productivity across different roles.

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the concepts and skills I am learning in **AI-Assisted Programming**. The key objective is to automate various tasks and workflows using AI, thereby showcasing its real-world benefits. It will evolve as I progress through the course, incorporating new insights and techniques.

### Key Features
- Automating repetitive tasks through AI.
- Linking different applications to streamline workflows.
- Utilizing **GenAI** to enable non-developers to benefit from programming.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone this repository to your local machine. The project may include scripts or instructions to help you implement AI-assisted workflows on your system.

### Prerequisites
- A basic understanding of programming concepts is helpful, though not required.
- Tools and platforms used will be documented as I continue building the project.

## How to Contribute

While this is a personal project as part of my learning, I welcome feedback and suggestions! If you're also learning or experimenting with AI, feel free to fork the repository and share your findings.

## Support

If you have any questions or need assistance, you can open an issue in the repository, and I will do my best to address it. As this is a learning project, some parts may be in development, so please bear with me!
